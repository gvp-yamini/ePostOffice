              <h3><font color="#4CD4CB">&nbsp;&nbsp;History of Philately in India</h3></font>
			  <p>The Indian Philatelic history began with the introduction of paper postage in India in 1852. Before that copper tokens were introduced for payment of postage in 1774. Their use was, however, not found to be very convenient and need was felt for some other token of pre-payment. With the success of Penny Postage in England, Sir Bartel Frere, the Commissioner of Sind introduced paper stamps for his province in 1852. These stamps, known as Scinde Dawk, were round in shape and were issued in three variations – embossed on white paper without colour, on white paper in blue and on vermilion wafers. They were withdrawn in October, 1854 on the introduction of the regular India Postage Stamps though their use continued for quite some time.</p>
           <p>In 1854, it was decided to issue stamps for the British India and in the interest of the economy, to have them printed them in India. The first design for the India Postage stamps was attempted by Col. Forbes of Calcutta Mint showing the 'Lion and the Palm tree'. It was a bold and imaginative design but somehow it could never be used. The next stamps to be designed and printed in 1854, by the Surveyor General's Office were blue lithographed half anna stamps showing a youthful profile of Queen Victoria.</p>
		   <p>While the first India Postage Stamps issued in 1854 bore the inscription 'India Postage', the inscription was changed in the same year to 'East India Postage'. This was changed from 1882 to 'India Postage' and continued till 1962. From November, 1962, a new caption 'भारत' 'INDIA' was introduced replacing the 'India Postage', though three stamps issued in December, 1962/January 1963 carried the earlier inscription.</p>
		   <p>From the beginning of British Imperialist Rule, when the Queen Victoria stamps were issued in 1854, a portrait of British Monarch had figured in Indian Stamp Designs. This came to an end with India gaining independence on 15th August, 1947. The first independence stamps, issued in 1947, were three in number. They depicted the Ashoka Pillar, (National Emblem of India) the Indian National Flag and an Aircraft. Since then India has issued more than 3000 Stamps.</p>
		   <h3><font color="#4CD4CB">&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth of Philately</h3></font>
		   <p>Postage stamp, which begun as a piece of paper in token of receipt of postage, has assumed additional functions. It is a mode of commemorating, celebrating and promoting national heritage and events. It plays a great role as an ambassador, a brand image of postal administration and a statement of sovereignty of a nation. After independence, the medium of postage stamps was initially used to highlight the country's achievements in science and technology as well as its socio-economic Development by depicting themes like the Five Year Plans, Steel Plants, Dams etc. Subsequently, the country's rich cultural and natural heritage came to be showcased and many beautiful stamps were issued in thematic sets on art, architecture, crafts maritime heritage, science, technology, defence and cinematic. Great leaders of national and international standing have also been honoured with commemorative stamps, the most prominent being Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation has been honoured with commemorative and definitive stamps. Personalities, who have made immense contributions in areas like painting, literature, science, music, social upliftment etc., have also been honoured.</p>
		   <p>In keeping with their dual character as a "Token of Postage" and as "Cultural Ambassador", there are two categories of stamps. The first is meant for day-to-day use as a token of payment of postage on mail articles. These incorporate less complicated design inputs, entailing minimum expenditure in their manufacture, and are printed in large quantities over longer periods. The second, on the other hand, are designed and printed with greater aesthetic inputs. They are manufactured in limited quantities and generate great interest among philatelists and collectors.</p>
